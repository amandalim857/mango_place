# MangoPlace - A Collaborative Canvas
## What is the project about?
Mangoplace is a fun collaborative space designed for a group of friends to create a montage. Each user places a pixel before waiting for a cooldown period of 5 minutes, and can either unite together to create a cohesive drawing or work to cover up an opposing team's art with your own. The frontend was made using Angular, whilst the backend consists of Flask, SQLite3 and pytest.

## Features
Currently, the game supports users changing a pixel colour after their cooldown period is completed, and allows a spectator mode for watching other players compete. Users can magnify and drag the canvas around for a better view.

## Potential Future Developments
In the future, the mechanism could be modified such that each user can place a specified amount of pixels before their cooldown period starts, encouraging the strategic use of their limited pixels, or for as many pixels to be placed within a given time duration that activates once the user starts putting pixels down.
